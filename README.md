# CORS Proxy

This is a simple proxy server that adds the necessary headers to allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for a specified website.

Currently the `project` branch is used primarily by the [Exoplanet Archive Search](http://jarvisar.github.io/senior-design)

To get the CORS Proxy up and running on your local machine, visit the [master](https://github.com/jarvisar/cors-proxy) branch.
